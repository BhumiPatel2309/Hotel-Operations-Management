This project will be mainly used by hotel owners and employees to simplify various day-to-day tasks. The Admin will be able to allot tasks to the workers and the task statuses will be updated by the respective workers. Room allocation process is simplified and various users can be created only by the Admin based on roles and permissions. The project has only login portal as this application will be used only by the peer employees working in a hotel, not external users so the register functionality is insignificant. Each employee can to login into the system by the credentials provided by the Admin which will be formed at the time of user creation. The Admin has centralized access to all the modules while certain modules are restricted to the employees.
