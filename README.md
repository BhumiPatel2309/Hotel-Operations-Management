 # **Week - 1**

Day 1 : An Introductory session was conducted about the company and its work in web and app development. An overview of the projects that we did earlier was taken. Communication took place about the known technology stack. Details were given about the project that we were going to do for a month. 

Day 2 : A research was carried out about how hotel management system works and what kind of problems occur in day-to-day life. We prepared flowcharts for the given project modules. 

Day 3 : Discussion about the tentative work flow, programming languages to be used, different access like super-admin and admin, work at the front-desk, work of inventory management team, appropriate notifications and alerts, housekeeping work, etc took place.

Day 4 : Inputs of the interns were taken. The plan is to create two dashboards: super-admin and admin. The admin will have sub-classes which will include front-desk employees, housekeeping workers, maintainence team and other categories. The super-admin dashboard controls the whole system. Each dashboard will have permissions according to their roles. The super-admin can modify the tasks alloted by admin. The child
classes of admin i.e., employees will receive a list of tasks that they have to checkmark when it is done. The completed task will be logged/recorded in the super-admin panel.
